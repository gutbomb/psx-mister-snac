# psx-mister-snac

This is based on schematics published here: https://github.com/blue212/SNAC-PSX

the screw holes in the case model are designed to use m2.5 screws and m2.5x4 heat set inserts.

You'll need a controller input unit from a real playstation.  it is designed to use the original ribbon cable.

Enjoy!
